  <h1>💌 My Love Letter To You</h1>

  <div class="letter">
    <p>
      My love,<br><br>

      From the moment you walked into my life, everything changed in the most
      beautiful way. Your smile became my favorite sight, your voice my
      favorite sound, and your happiness my greatest wish.<br><br>

      You make ordinary days feel magical, and even in silence, being with you
      feels like home. I choose you today, tomorrow, and every day after that.<br><br>

      Thank you for being you — my heart, my happiness, my Valentine. 💖<br><br>

      Forever yours,<br>
      ❤️
